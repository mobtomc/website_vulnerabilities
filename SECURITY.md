## Reporting a Vulnerability
At Web Vulnerability Scanning and Exploitation Script, I take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate your efforts in responsibly disclosing any potential vulnerabilities you may find. To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

- Contact me directly at [mejbaur.bahar@gmaul.com] to report the vulnerability details.
- Provide sufficient information, including steps to reproduce, potential impact, and any proof-of-concept code or exploit.
- I will acknowledge your report within [07] business days and keep you informed of the progress towards addressing the vulnerability.
- Once the vulnerability is resolved, I will provide appropriate credits and recognition to the reporter (if desired).
Please refrain from publicly disclosing the vulnerability until I have confirmed and resolved the issue, to prevent any potential misuse or harm.
